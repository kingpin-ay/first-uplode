first of all you can use whatever suits your test for the music playing thing 

here I uses the playsound module or you can use the mpg123 
downlode it and set it as a enviormental element in your pc 
then you can good to go 


link for downlode mpg123 -

https://www.mpg123.de/download/win64/1.26.4/


So this thing work just like when you put a song name it's find the song from the youtube and downlode the full video in a folder that you have to create for your self I created one for me
then the video will convert into a audio file and then mpg123 will able to run it in the cmd or whatever console you are using 


so first of all you have to create a folder for it to downlode the video and extracted audio to store
